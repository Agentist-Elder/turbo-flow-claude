Add this to your zshrc or bashrc, etc

devpod-turbo() {
  devpod up --devcontainer-path devpods/rackspace-devcontainer.json https://github.com/marcuspat/turbo-flow-claude
}

source your rc:

source ~/.zshrc 

Then you can simply invoke the devpod by typing the following:

devpod-turbo <github repo url>

This will create a pod on the kubernetes node, boot the linux image and run the turbo flow scripts which installs all the goodies.
