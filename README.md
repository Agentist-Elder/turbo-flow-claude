```

### 2. Setup DigitalOcean Provider

#### Create DigitalOcean Account & API Token
1. Sign up at [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
2. Go to API â†’ Personal access tokens
3. Generate new token with read/write permissions
4. Copy the token (you'll need it in the next step)

#### Configure DevPod with DigitalOcean
```bash
# Add DigitalOcean as provider
devpod provider add digitalocean

# Configure with your API token
devpod provider use digitalocean

# Set your API token (replace with your actual token)
devpod provider update digitalocean --option DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Optional: Set droplet size (default is 8GB RAM)
# 2GB RAM ($12/month) - Good for most development
devpod provider update digitalocean --option DROPLET_SIZE=s-2vcpu-2gb

# 4GB RAM ($24/month) - For memory-intensive work
devpod provider update digitalocean --option DROPLET_SIZE=s-2vcpu-4gb

# 8GB RAM ($48/month) - Current default, best performance
devpod provider update digitalocean --option DROPLET_SIZE=s-4vcpu-8gb
```

### 3. Fix DevPod Permissions (macOS/Linux)
If you encounter permission errors, run this one-time fix:
```bash
# Fix all DevPod permissions (run once)
sudo chown -R $(whoami):staff ~/.devpod && \
find ~/.devpod -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \; && \
find ~/.devpod -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \; && \
find ~/.devpod -name "*provider*" -type f -path "*/binaries/*" -exec chmod +x {} \; && \
find ~/.devpod -name "devpod*" -type f -exec chmod +x {} \;
```

### 4. Verify Installation
```bash
# Check DevPod version
devpod version

# List available providers
devpod provider list

# Test DigitalOcean connection
devpod provider test digitalocean
```

## Recent Updates (Enhanced Monitoring & Development Fundamentals)

We've upgraded the Claude monitoring system from the basic `claude-usage-cli` to the advanced **Claude Monitor** by @Maciek-roboblog, featuring ML-based predictions, beautiful Rich terminal UI, real-time analytics, and intelligent session limit detection. 

More significantly, we've implemented a comprehensive development methodology where the **doc-planner** and **microtask-breakdown** agents are now mandatory for ALL work - individual tasks, swarms, and hive-minds. This ensures every coding session begins with proper documentation planning (SPARC workflow) and atomic 10-minute tasks (TDD principles).

### New Development Fundamentals:
- **Playwright Integration**: All frontend/web development now requires Playwright for screenshots and visual verification
- **Recursive Problem Solving**: Complex problems are broken down recursively to atomic, solvable units
- **Iterate Until Success**: Tasks continue until the goal is achieved - no giving up
- **Deep Research Protocol**: When stuck, agents automatically search YouTube transcripts, GitHub repos, and blogs for solutions
- **Date Context**: Current date is always specified for time-sensitive information
- **Swarm vs Hive Guidance**: Clear decision tree for choosing the right coordination pattern

These fundamentals are embedded throughout the claude.md configuration, ensuring consistent, well-structured, and persistent development workflows. The monitor runs in tmux window 2, while the enhanced protocols are prominently displayed at session start.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create DevPod Workspace
```bash
devpod up https://github.com/marcuspat/turbo-flow-claude --ide vscode
```

This single command:
- Creates a DigitalOcean droplet (VM)
- Builds a Docker container with all features
- Installs all tools and 600+ agents
- Configures the development environment
- Opens VSCode connected to the container

### 2. Automatic Setup
When VSCode opens, the workspace automatically:
- **postCreateCommand**: Runs setup.sh to install all dependencies and agents
- **postAttachCommand**: Runs post-setup.sh to verify installations and create tmux workspace
- **Terminal Profile**: Auto-connects to tmux workspace when opening terminals

The tmux workspace includes 4 windows:
- **Window 0 (Claude-1)**: Primary Claude workspace
- **Window 1 (Claude-2)**: Secondary Claude workspace
- **Window 2 (Claude-Monitor)**: Running `claude-monitor` for usage monitoring
- **Window 3 (htop)**: System resource monitor

### 3. Using Claude Agents
```bash
# List all available agents
ls /workspaces/turbo-flow-claude/agents/*.md | wc -l

# Search for specific agents
ls /workspaces/turbo-flow-claude/agents/*test*.md

# Tell Claude to use agents
"Look in /workspaces/turbo-flow-claude/agents/ and select the best agents for [task]"

# Load a specific agent
cat /workspaces/turbo-flow-claude/agents/doc-planner.md
```

## Management Commands

### Create and Delete Workspace
```bash
# Create workspace
devpod up https://github.com/marcuspat/turbo-flow-claude --ide vscode

# Delete workspace completely
devpod delete turbo-flow-claude --force

# Force delete if needed
devpod delete turbo-flow-claude --force
```

### DevPod Management
```bash
# List workspaces
devpod list

# SSH into workspace
devpod ssh turbo-flow-claude

# Stop workspace (preserves everything, stops billing for compute)
devpod stop turbo-flow-claude

# Resume workspace
devpod up turbo-flow-claude --ide vscode
```

## ðŸš€ Complete Prompting Guide - Maximize Your Agent Hivemind

### The Master Pattern
Always include this in your prompts to maximize agent effectiveness:
```
"Identify all of the subagents that could be useful in any way for this task and then figure out how to utilize the claude-flow hivemind to maximize your ability to accomplish the task."
```

### Essential Prompting Examples

#### Example 1: Full Project Development with Visualizations
```
"I need to build a REST API for a todo application. Look in /workspaces/turbo-flow-claude/agents/ and:
1. Identify all subagents that could be useful for this task
2. Create a complete development plan with visualizations
3. Break down the plans into many SVG visualizations that are simple and explainable
4. Figure out how to utilize the claude-flow hivemind to maximize our ability to accomplish this
5. Chain the appropriate agents together for planning, implementation, testing, and deployment
6. Create visualizations of what I would build first
7. Make sure visualizations are extremely explainable and understandable by a human being"
```

#### Example 2: Complex Analysis with Visual Breakdowns
```
"Analyze this codebase and create visualizations of what I would build first. 
- Break down all plans into many many visualizations that would be useful to someone about to develop this project
- Make sure it's done in simple SVG so it's extremely explainable and understandable by a human being
- That is your ultimate goal
- Identify all subagents that could be useful in any way for this task
- Figure out how to utilize the claude-flow hivemind to maximize your ability to accomplish the task"
```

#### Example 3: Business and Life Enhancement (500+ Non-Coding Agents)
```
"I want to improve my startup's development workflow. There are agents to help with all aspects of your business and life. 500+ Non Coding Agents. Claude Code has access to the internet and any MCP tools you give it. Simply tell it what you want and then tell it to:
- Identify all subagents that could be useful for workflow optimization
- Create visual diagrams of the current vs improved workflow
- Utilize the claude-flow hivemind to create a comprehensive improvement plan
- Include agents for project management, team coordination, and productivity"
```

#### Example 4: Infrastructure Research & Implementation
```
"Draft detailed research into using rackspace spot H100-enabled servers to spawn a self hosted LLM service on rackspace spot compute platform using kubernetes. Put the output into research/rackspace folder. Draw information from youtube transcripts (tools/youtube-transcript-api), github repos, blog posts, and any web-accessible source. Draft detailed instructions to create the kubernetes manifests to serve the likes of qwen3 coder, kimi k2, and other state of the art models. Remember the current date is August 22, 2025. Spawn 5 agents to work on this process concurrently. Use the available MCP servers to conduct this research. Keep iterating until a clear path to implementation exists. Include cost analysis on a per 1 million token basis based on a H100 bid price of $0.71/hr."
```

#### Example 5: Creative Animation Project with Visual Verification
```
"Create a folder in /front-end-demo/ create a detailed animation using anime.js highlighting the benefits of pineapple on pizza. Spawn 3 agents to work on this project in parallel. Use the available MCP servers. Install playwright and use playwright to generate screenshots of the created webpage animation using a 400x750px viewport. Create an animation where the pizza spins as the user scrolls down where pineapple slices are added or removed from the pizza as the user scrolls. Keep iterating until the animation is smooth and will reliably work on mobile devices. If stuck, contact deep research using web-accessible sources, github repos, and youtube video transcripts to identify solutions."
```

#### Example 6: Multi-Agent Research Coordination
```
"I need to research Kubernetes LLM serving, cost optimization, and deployment patterns. Current date is August 22, 2025.
- Spawn specialized agents for: Infrastructure (kimi k2), Cost analysis (Triton), GPU optimization ($0.71/hr H100 spot)
- Create parallel deployment strategies using available MCP servers
- Keep iterating until implementation path is clear
- Use web-accessible sources, GitHub repos, and YouTube video transcripts
- Coordinate findings across all agents to identify optimal solutions
- Ask yourself: should I use swarm or hivemind for this task?"
```

### Advanced Prompting Techniques

#### Recursive Problem Solving with Deep Research
```
"Use recursive thinking to break down this problem. If you get stuck, spawn a research agent to do deep research into:
- YouTube transcripts for tutorials
- GitHub repos for implementation examples  
- Blog posts for best practices
- Analyze existing code for patterns
- Search all web-accessible resources
Keep recursing until you find a working solution. If stuck, do deep research to come up with solutions to try."
```

#### TDD with Goal Achievement and Iteration
```
"Define the end result: A working API with 100% test coverage
Use TDD approach and iterate until goal is achieved:
1. Write failing tests for each endpoint
2. Implement minimal code to pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Iterate until all acceptance criteria are met
5. Use playwright to take screenshots and verify GUI output is correct
6. If tests fail, do prompt-specific research and try again
7. Keep iterating until goal is achieved
Use CC (Claude Code) for more tasks"
```

#### Visual Verification Loop with Playwright
```
"Build the dashboard component:
1. Create the UI component
2. Install and use playwright for screenshots so the agent can verify the output in the GUI is correct
3. Take a screenshot at 1920x1080 resolution
4. Verify the output matches the design specs
5. If not correct, iterate on the CSS/layout
6. Keep iterating until pixel-perfect
7. Use recursive thinking if stuck
Use CC (Claude Code) for implementing changes"
```

#### Deep Research Pattern
```
"Research the best approach for implementing real-time collaborative editing. Current date is August 22, 2025.
1. Search all web-accessible resources from the last 2 years
2. Analyze YouTube video transcripts for 'collaborative editing implementation'
3. Study GitHub repos using CRDTs or OT algorithms
4. Read blog posts about scaling collaborative apps
5. Analyze code for desired patterns
6. Do research for desired result
7. Feed findings from MCP tools into your analysis
8. Describe the way - multiple implementation paths with pros/cons"
```

#### Folder-Specific Analysis
```
"Only read contents of the /src/components folder and do this:
1. Identify all components that need refactoring
2. Create a prioritized list based on complexity
3. For each component, suggest modern React patterns
4. Don't look at any other folders - focus only on components
You can tell it to only read contents of this folder and do this..."
```

#### Swarm vs Hivemind Decision
```
"I need to process 10,000 customer support tickets. Ask Claude which to use:
- Should I use a swarm pattern (independent agents working on batches)?
- Or hivemind pattern (agents sharing context and learning from each other)?
Analyze the task characteristics and recommend the best approach with reasoning.
Ask yourself: hivemind or swarm?"
```

#### MCP Integration Pattern
```
"Use MCP tools to gather context, then feed MCP into Claude prompts:
1. Use web_search MCP to find latest LLM serving benchmarks
2. Feed search results to the performance-analysis agent
3. Use github MCP to find relevant repos
4. Feed code examples to the implementation agent
5. Coordinate findings across all agents
6. Present unified recommendations
Feed MCP into Claude prompts for enhanced context"
```

#### Goal-Driven Iteration with Fallbacks
```
"End goal: Production-ready authentication system
Current date: August 22, 2025
1. Define end result and success criteria (tests, security, performance)
2. Start with TDD - write comprehensive test suite
3. Implement iteratively until all tests pass
4. If stuck on any test, do deep research:
   - Search for 'authentication best practices 2025'
   - Analyze top auth libraries on GitHub
   - Review security blog posts
   - YouTube transcripts for implementation guides
5. Use playwright to test the login flow visually
6. Iterate until goal - 100% test coverage and visual verification passes
7. If primary approach fails, research alternatives"
```

### Key Prompting Principles

1. **Always specify the current date** - "Remember the current date is August 22, 2025"
2. **Define clear end goals** - "Define the end result" - Agents work better with specific targets
3. **Use iterative refinement** - "Keep iterating until [specific condition]" - "Iterate until goal"
4. **Leverage visual verification** - "Install and use playwright for screenshots" - GUI testing
5. **Combine research and implementation** - "If stuck do deep research" using all sources
6. **Choose the right pattern** - "Ask Claude whether to use swarm or hivemind"
7. **Feed MCP into prompts** - "Feed MCP into Claude prompts" for context
8. **Spawn agents concurrently** - "Spawn 5 agents to work on this process concurrently"
9. **Specify output locations** - "Put the output into research/rackspace folder"
10. **Include fallback strategies** - "If stuck, do deep research to come up with solutions to try"
11. **Use recursive thinking** - Break down problems recursively
12. **Prompt-specific research** - Research tailored to the specific problem
13. **Describe the way** - Have agents explain their approach
14. **Use CC for more tasks** - Leverage Claude Code for implementation
15. **Search all web-accessible resources** - YouTube, GitHub, blogs, etc.
