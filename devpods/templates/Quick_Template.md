## QUICK TEMPLATE NOTES

### When to Use This Template

Use this condensed version when:

- [ ] Spec is for internal team (less context needed)
- [ ] Project is relatively straightforward
- [ ] Timeline is short (<3 months)
- [ ] Audience is already familiar with domain
- [ ] Emphasis is on speed over comprehensiveness

### When to Use Full Template

Use the comprehensive template when:

- [ ] Spec is for external stakeholders
- [ ] Project is complex or novel
- [ ] Timeline is extended (3+ months)
- [ ] Audience needs significant context
- [ ] Detail and proof are critical

### Minimum Required Sections

1. **Executive Summary** - Always include
2. **Problem Statement** - Establish need
3. **Solution Architecture** - Show approach
4. **Implementation Plan** - Demonstrate feasibility
5. **Conclusion** - Synthesize value

### Quick Filling Guide

1. **Start with Executive Summary** - If you can't fill these 4 questions concisely, you need more clarity on the project
2. **Add metrics everywhere** - Replace adjectives with numbers
3. **Show, don't tell** - Include code/diagrams, not just descriptions
4. **Cite precedent** - Reference existing successful systems
5. **Be realistic** - Honest about limitations and tradeoffs

### Expansion Path

To convert this quick template to the full template:

1. Expand Problem Statement → Add threat analysis or detailed context
2. Add Technical Deep Dive → Create new section after Architecture
3. Expand Examples → Add 2-3 more use cases
4. Add Models section → Performance/cost formulas
5. Expand Testing → Add security/integration details
6. Add Integration section → Platform-specific guides
7. Expand Documentation → Link to comprehensive docs

---

**Pro tip:** Start with this quick template to get ideas on paper, then expand sections that need more detail. Don't write the full template if this one suffices for your audience.
