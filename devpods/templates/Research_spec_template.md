## USAGE NOTES FOR THIS TEMPLATE

### Required Sections (Adapt naming to fit your domain)

1. **Title & Executive Summary** - Always include
2. **Problem/Background Section** - Establish context and need
3. **Solution Architecture** - Core technical approach
4. **Implementation Plan** - Phased delivery approach
5. **Technical Deep Dive** - At least one section with detailed specs
6. **Conclusion** - Synthesize key points

### Optional Sections (Include as relevant)

- Code examples (essential for programming languages, SDKs, libraries)
- Cost models (for infrastructure, SaaS, or resource-intensive systems)
- Security models (for security tools or systems handling sensitive data)
- Performance benchmarks (for performance-critical systems)
- Integration guides (for tools/platforms meant to integrate with others)

### Adaptation Guidelines

1. **Adjust depth based on audience:**
   - Technical audience: More code, formulas, and architectural details
   - Business audience: More problem statements, ROI, and use cases
   - Mixed audience: Balance both with clear section delineation

2. **Scale the implementation plan:**
   - Small projects: Week-by-week milestones
   - Large projects: Month-by-month phases
   - Very large: Quarter-by-quarter roadmap

3. **Customize section titles:**
   - Replace generic headers with domain-specific terms
   - Example: "Defense Mechanisms" for security, "Compiler Architecture" for languages

4. **Balance breadth and depth:**
   - Include enough detail to be actionable
   - Avoid overwhelming with minutiae
   - Use appendices for extensive technical details

5. **Include proof points:**
   - Reference existing systems/research
   - Cite performance benchmarks
   - Show real-world examples
   - Demonstrate production viability

### Writing Tips

- **Be specific:** Use concrete metrics, not vague claims
- **Show tradeoffs:** Acknowledge limitations and design decisions
- **Provide evidence:** Back claims with data, citations, or examples
- **Maintain consistency:** Use parallel structure for similar sections
- **Enable skimming:** Use clear headers, bold key terms, code blocks
- **Think progression:** Order from high-level to detailed within sections
