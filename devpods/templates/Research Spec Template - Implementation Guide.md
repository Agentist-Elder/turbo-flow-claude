## Template Customization Decision Matrix

### When to Emphasize Performance Metrics

**Include extensive performance data if:**
- [ ] System has hard performance requirements (latency, throughput)
- [ ] Performance is a key differentiator vs. competitors
- [ ] Real-time or high-frequency operations are involved
- [ ] Cost scales with performance (compute, API calls)

**Examples from specs:**
- Language spec: "sub-100ms compilation", "nanosecond-scale message passing"
- AgentDB: "⚡ <10ms startup", "116K vectors/sec"
- poison-pill: "200x faster than pure JavaScript"

### When to Emphasize Security/Threat Models

**Include detailed security analysis if:**
- [ ] System handles untrusted input
- [ ] Security is the primary value proposition
- [ ] Compliance requirements exist
- [ ] Attack surface needs documentation

**Examples from specs:**
- poison-pill: Extensive attack taxonomy with documented exploits
- Language spec: Formal verification for security-critical paths
- AgentDB: Less emphasis, mentions MCP security implicitly

### When to Emphasize Integration Patterns

**Include extensive integration docs if:**
- [ ] Tool needs to work with multiple platforms/frameworks
- [ ] Ecosystem adoption is critical
- [ ] Multiple deployment targets exist
- [ ] Developer experience is a differentiator

**Examples from specs:**
- AgentDB: MCP, CLI, Browser, Edge, programmatic APIs
- poison-pill: Express middleware, standalone CLI, Lambda integration
- Language spec: Focus on compiler internals, less on integrations

### When to Emphasize Cost Models

**Include detailed cost analysis if:**
- [ ] Infrastructure costs are significant
- [ ] Multi-provider optimization exists
- [ ] TCO is a business driver
- [ ] Resource allocation is dynamic

**Examples from specs:**
- Language spec: Extensive TCO models, multi-lane costs, spot instance optimization
- AgentDB: Minimal (just footprint comparisons)
- poison-pill: Processing overhead, not infrastructure costs

## Common Patterns Across All Three Specs

### What They All Do Well

1. **Concrete Metrics**
   - Language: "sub-100ms", "nanosecond-scale"
   - AgentDB: "116K vectors/sec", "<10ms startup"
   - poison-pill: "200x faster", "80-100% attack success rate"

2. **Proven Technology References**
   - Language: Lean4, Rust, Erlang, Zig, LLVM
   - AgentDB: SQLite, better-sqlite3, HNSW algorithm
   - poison-pill: lopdf, aho-corasick, unicode-normalization

3. **Real-World Examples**
   - Language: seL4 verification effort, MLGO optimizations
   - AgentDB: MCP integration, Claude Desktop usage
   - poison-pill: Snyk demonstration, ICLR 2026 papers

4. **Visual Architecture**
   - All three use ASCII diagrams for data flows
   - Clear component separation
   - Timing information on transitions

5. **Phased Approach**
   - All break work into phases with clear milestones
   - Each phase builds on previous
   - Week/month estimates included

### What to Avoid

1. **Vague Claims**
   - ❌ "Very fast" → ✅ "<10ms startup time"
   - ❌ "Highly secure" → ✅ "Blocks 99.8% of homoglyph attacks"
   - ❌ "Easy to use" → ✅ "60-second setup with zero configuration"

2. **Missing Proof**
   - ❌ Claiming without evidence
   - ✅ Citing benchmarks, research papers, or existing implementations

3. **All Theory, No Practice**
   - ❌ Only describing what could be built
   - ✅ Including code examples, deployment instructions, real usage

**Remember:** The best specs balance comprehensiveness with clarity. Include enough detail to be actionable, but not so much that key points are lost. Use the template as a guide, not a straitjacket.
